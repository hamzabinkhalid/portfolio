              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p class="intro">Is there software that can tell if a person is suffering from a mental illness? Or a computer program that aids people with disability. Which cutting edge software tools and technologies can be used to achieve tasks like these? I aspire to develop peculiar and nifty software like these, so that I could play my part in the amelioration of the society and to progress my career by following my passion.<br>
                  
I am extremely passionate about computers and technology since my childhood, as I grew older I started developing a persistent penchant for software and how they are created, seeing what a few lines of computer code can do inspired me to learn to code even before getting into the university and when I started my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science this interest amplified extraordinarily thus I performed well, frequently and consistently in my degree courses especially in the courses that involves programming,  some of which include Java Software Development Paradigm, Mobile Application Development, Web Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Object Oriented Programming offered in the third and fourth year of my bachelors studies, I had percentage standing of above 80% in all these subjects. This taught me the intricacies of software development in mobile, desktop, web and cross platform applications.<br>
                  
I found delight in Software Development and while I grasped most of what was to offer during my studies I still had strong innate desire to study core Computer Science subjects in more depth, moreover a craving to learn the cutting edge technical and programming skills. As a step towards this goal I decided to study MSc Computing Placement Route where I can not only add more to my technical skillset but also get an opportunity to append my practical expertise as well with the option of a placement year. And finally thank you for reading about me.

              <p class="intro">If I start to work on a problem I would give it all of my time and effort until it is solved, which almost always gives a fulfilling feeling.
                I am at my best when working alone on an assignment but I do not mind working in team. Because of my passion for software development I would even spend nights solving and thinking about a problem and different ways to go about it until something clicks in my mind. I really value the advice and criticism from my mentors, friends and colleagues because I know I am human and bound to make mistakes but it is upon me to make myself better by not repeating the mistakes.</p>
